# Authors
The model and coding files uploaded to this repo are authored by Catherine Knox, with contributions from Jonathan Lamontagne and Abigail Birnbaum. This repository provides to run the Boston Sea Level Rise Adaptation Model and to analyze output data. This repository accompanies the paper written by Catherine Knox, Paul Kirhsen, Jonathan Lamontagne, and Shafiqul Islam at Tufts University. 

# Purpose
The model was designed to quantify the trade-offs of three adaptation regimes in Boston Harbor: no cooperation, voluntary cooperation, or a regional authority. The model contains options for expliclty incorporating numerous levers in coastal, behavioral, legislative, and financial systems.

# Repository Overview
The repo contains files necessary to run the SLR model and analyze the outputs, contained in the relevant files. All data used for the paper, [INSERT PAPER NAME], are stored in a separate zenodo repository: [INSERT LINK/DOI].

# To run the model:
Running the model requires a user to have both NetLogo 6.4 and python installed. The python version used for model development is 3.12 but other versions of python may be sufficient. All files supporting the NetLogo model must be installed in the same folder. Experiments can be run through NetLogo's Behvarior Space and saved as outputs to the user's computer.
